## GCP:
While Colab is good for assignments, and is still a helpful and free tool for experimentation for your project, you will likely need a dedicated GPU instance when you start training on large datasets. The following link is really helpful for setting up the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This instructoin is provided by cs231n as well.
